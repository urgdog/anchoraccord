  <summary>Scaling, Stalled: How Invisible Infrastructure Debt Drains Product Momentum</summary>
  <p>
   As a firm scaled, repeated technical breakdowns quietly began eating
   into its core mission: instead of accelerating discovery, teams found
   themselves mired in troubleshooting. Infrastructure wasnâ€™t failing
   in dramatic ways, it was just misaligned, invisible, and slow to adapt. Time
   was lost, momentum slipped, and product development suffered. This case
   explores how treating infrastructure as a cost center, rather than a force
   multiplier created drag the company couldn't afford.

  multiple institutions: unclear system ownership, broken triage workflows, and 
  misaligned alert logic that overwhelms staff while underperforming on actual 
  risk.
