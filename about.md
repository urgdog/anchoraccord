We’re not a consulting shop with templates and handoffs.

We’re two senior operators who’ve seen what happens when
infrastructure and compliance are treated like cost
centers—until it’s too late, and expensive consultants
deliver ineffective solutions too slowly, at exorbitant cost.

We're looking to change that.

**Gregory C. Ross**  
Infrastructure and networking specialist with two decades 
of experience. Built and led critical systems teams at 
nation-wide ISPs (Internet Service Providers) supporting real-time network operations across hundreds of thousands of devices and millions of subscribers.

Infrastructure strategist, automation obsessive, deeply
allergic to performative ops.  

Thinks in wires, writes in Python, and prefers systems
that explain themselves.

**Nicole J. Gray**  
CAMS-certified compliance executive with two decade of
leadership in AML, BSA, OFAC, and FCC controls.  
Specializes in compliance remediation, regulatory posture,
policy alignment, and risk reduction.  

Has outperformed consultants from the big firms—and cleaned
up after them, too.

**Together, we combine technical clarity with regulatory rigor without inflating the headcount.**
